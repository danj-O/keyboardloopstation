# Computer Keyboard Loop Station
A sampler and loop station built so a user can play a song or jam with only a computer keyboard. 
Contains:
drum samples and looper
fully chromatic synth keys with 2 loopers (ex. bass + melody)
dynamic delay triggers for on/off, feedback and timing on all tracks separately
mute/unmute anything with shift controls

To start, turn on DSP and turn up the volume.
a w d - are kick, hihat and snare.
spacebar - init loop
q - begin loop playback

TIP-- you might need to hit spacebar then q then ` then esc to get the first round of loops going.
Also, you may have to unmute tracks and drum samples by hitting shift+a (for unmute kick for example) shift + w, shift+/

The rest of the controls are hidden in the comments. Good luck!
